# DeepFaceLabClient

> [!CAUTION]
> I'm aware that for some people the GPU is not showing up in the GPU section https://github.com/Lenny4/DeepFaceLabClient/issues/73. As I don't have a graphic card I can't reproduce the bug and therefore I can't fix it. We are looking for someone who can actually reproduce the bug and has someone knowledge in Dart. This way I can connect to his PC with TeamViewer and try to fix it. If you are in this situation, please send me an email to `alexandre.beaujour@hotmail.fr`

Just an app to use [DeepFaceLab](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab) with a user interface.
